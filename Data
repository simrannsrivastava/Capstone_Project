My idea is to find the various restaurants, cafes, and other places to eat in the city of Vancouver and cluster them based on their 
locations and ratings. This would target a wide audience, i.e, anyone who may be looking to eat outside based on the ratings of the 
eateries.
For this problem I will be using mainly the foursquare api and its location data. Along with that I will use the KNN clustering method for
creating the clusters.
